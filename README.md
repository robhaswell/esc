# EVE Shopping Cart
EVE Online features a useful "multibuy" feature for letting you buy ship fittings in only a couple of clicks.
Unfortunately CCP has not included a way to load arbitrary items into the "multibuy", meaning capsuleers must continue to purchase their material lists and other shopping needs manually.

`esc` allows you to paste in a list of items and counts, and will then create a Capsule fitting which can then be purchased with multibuy.
In order to do this, you will be requested to authorize the application with EVE Online's SSO.

## FC how do?

Paste items and counts separated by either commas or tabs.
Your shopping list can have items and counts in either order, it does not matter.

## I can bring draek?

No, you cannot purchase ships using this tool, only modules and materials.
